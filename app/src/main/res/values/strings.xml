    <string name="whatTitle">What this app does:</string>
    <string name="whatBody">Once you click \"Start\", this app collects data from your phone\'s gyroscope, accelerometer, light sensor, proximity sensor, microphone, touch events on the touchscreen
        and if your face is visibile from the front camera. You can stop the data collection at any time by pressing \"Stop\". The microphone records sound for 2 seconds every 10 seconds. The camera takes a photo every 10 seconds, scans for
        a face, and saves a 0 if it doesn\'t see any faces, 1 if it does. No photos are saved. When you decide to upload your data, it is saved anonomously on an online server
        for data collection. We have no way of recognising who the data belongs to, once it is stored on the online server.</string>
